This project applies a fine-tuned Transformation model (https://huggingface.co/tasks/sentence-similarity) to address the problem of automating the process of generating questions from a pair of context and answer. 
Dumping the traditional way, I use NLP techniques to automate the task of generating questions from text at scale, and ensure that the questions generated are accurate, relevant, and appropriate for the intended use case.
The Question Answer Generator can solve real-life problems in various domains, including education, content creation,Q&A chatbots, and customer service,etc. 
Particularly, this model has been extend to Chinese dataset, and hence it becomes a Bilingual QA generator.
